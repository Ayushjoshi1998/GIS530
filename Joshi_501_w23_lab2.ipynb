We're going to be focusing on solving problems using a fundamental element of flow control: the if/then statement.\n\nThe second half of this lab and next week's class will go over iteration and flow control (loops, etc.), but for the first half, you just need to think about the statement like this: \"*If* something is true, *then* do something; *if not* do something else.\"\n\nThe best way to understand that is with some hands on examples, so let's get started.",

      "source": "# But, first some housekeeping.\n\nThis lab should appear to you as a series of markdown and code boxes with which you can interact. **If** it appears as a statically rendered page (try clicking on a box), then you are not loading it within jupyter or arcgis. Let's talk about how you set up environments for a moment.\n\n\n## The following is how to set up your lab using anaconda. If you are using arcgis, please skip to the next section.\nI like to create a new environment for each lab. This keeps everything nice and tiday and makes sure that any conflicts between versions of libraries are handled 'automagically' (*usually*). But, I've also had students create a single environment for each class. Feel free to do either. For now, let's talk about how you create en environment.\n\n**I am assuming that you have anaconda installed and are able to get to the anaconda prompt**. If that is not the case, [go here and do so](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n\nWith your prompt staring at you, you can create an environment like so:\n`conda create -n lab2 python=3.7`\n\nThat tells conda to create an environment named (-n) lab2 and to install python version 3.7 with it. You could just as easily give it another name or a different version of python. Anaconda will go out and find all the packages necessary to do this and prompt you that you are sure you want to install them, you are. **Note: If you are using the ESRI python prompt, you may get an error if you try to use a version of python other than 3.8**\n\nOk, now once that's completed, it's time to activate your environment. You do so like so:\n\n**In windows:** `conda activate lab2`\n\n**In mac/linux:** `source activate lab2`\n\nYou should now have `(lab2)` to the left of your prompt. This means that you are in the environment you created. \n\nNow it's time to install the packages we'll need for this lab. In this case, we only need jupyter notebooks, so go ahead and type:\n`conda install jupyter`\n\nThis tells Anaconda to go out and find all the packages needed to run jupyter notebooks. You'll be prompted that you want to install them, you'll say yes again.\n\nOnce ***all that*** is done, type in `jupyter notebook` and a notebook application should launch in your web browser. At that point, simply navigate to this file and open it again. **Boom**, you're ready to go.\n\n#### This may seem like a lot, but with time it will become like second nature. I recommend taking some time now to play with Anaconda and Jupyter; they are both extremely useful tools that, along with github, will help you organize and create amazing scripts.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Here are the instructions if you are choosing to remain within Arcgis (and its version of anaconda and jupyter).\n\nESRI, in their vast wisdom, both installs a version of anaconda to manage packages within Arcgis Pro's python environment(s) **and** now allows you to open notebooks directly within ArcGIS Pro.\n\nIf you want to use the command prompt, look for what ESRI calls the \"Python Command Prompt\" in your Windows Menu. It will load into what amounts to an anaconda prompt, but places you in a default `(arcgispro-py3)` environment. This means that anything you install (unless you change environments) will be included in the environment used by Arcgis Pro. This has benefits and dangers! You can both extend the functionality of python with ArcGIS Pro *and* potentially install something that doesn't work with core features of ArcGIS Pro. Fun!\n\nOnce you have the command prompt open, go to the directions above for anaconda. They are identical because... ESRI is just using a version of anaconda! Sneaky!\n\nIf you prefer to stick entirely to the GUI (not recommended, but you should find the path for coding that works best for you), **pages 229 to 250** of your textbook cover this topic. You can also read the ESRI documentation [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/pro-notebooks.htm). \n\n---\n\n#### Of course, I'll be showing you **all** methods in class, so pay attention, review the videos, and read the documentation! \n\n#### Finally, think about your workflow. How will you *pull* things down from our class repository and *push* them up when you are done. **Set up your workflow now!**\n\n# Still with me, great. Let's look at `if` statements\n",

Some of these problems will have immediate applied uses, while others will simply be asking you to think computationally – about what you can and cannot solve using Python and how it might be used in a variety of generalized tasks. You will also gain familiarity with the specific syntax of the Python language.\n\nThere are a wide variety of articles, guides, tutorials, and reference materials available on the Python language. You’re encouraged to read through many of these and refer to them when you run into difficulty. Make sure you understand why any solution works or you will run into significant difficulties later. **But, never forget your assigned readings and lectures.

You can load the file directly from the web (which we'll cover in a later lab, but if you feel like diving in, check out this [stack overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1393324/in-python-given-a-url-to-a-text-file-what-is-the-simplest-way-to-read-the-cont) or [this module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

Case **does not** matter - so 'Whisker' should be the same as 'whisker.'\n2. Make sure you strip out punctuation - otherwise 'whisker?' and 'whisker!' will come back as different words.\n3. Plurals are different words in this exercise - 'whiskers' and 'whisker' count separately.\n\nA few hints:\n1. Check out the [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections) module.\n2. One way to do this would be to create a dictionary of each word and then check the dictionaries length.\n3. You should get around 3,000 words depending on what assumptions you bake into this.

You need to analyze said matrix to see if within it there exists a 2 by 2 grid of all vowels (hint: there is). If so, you print out the members of that grid; if not, you print out \"No match found.\"\n\nIn other words, I'm going to give you something like this:\n\na b c d e f\n\ng h i j k l\n\n**a a** k e v o\n\n**i o** e r p z\n\nAnd, you'd need to return a a i o.\n\n**THIS IS HARD**. Work together! Don't look up a solution, do think about how you might parse through this. There are many solutions, one I might consider is creating a new matrix that simple records if something is a vowel or not (i.e. a 1 value for a vowel, a 0 for not, etc.). *Partial credit is possible*.",

I'll be using the Lovecraft here, just because it's on hand and you'll be able to follow note for note.\n\nMarkovify has directions at the link above which are pretty straightforward. But, I'll also give you example code below. Poke at it, change some things up! Did you know you can combine texts (and even weight them differently) to produce different 'voices.' This is an incredibly simple model, but it's a lot of fun. If you'd like to see where the state of the art is right now, check out [GPT-3](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3) or the API for it [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)).\n\nOnce you get the hang of it (changing texts, sentence length, etc.), go look at the documentation linked above. You'll find lots of ways to tweak the output - from changing the depth of the search (roughly how many words must be strung together in the model) to weighting different texts differently.",
